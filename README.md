# Predictive Pancreas: Harnessing AI for Diabetes Risk Assessment



## Overview

Predictive Pancreas is an innovative project that leverages artificial intelligence to assess the risk of diabetes in individuals. The project focuses on predictive modeling using a dataset enriched with various medical predictor variables, including the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels, age, and other significant parameters.

## Key Features

 **Comprehensive Dataset:** The dataset used in this project incorporates diverse medical predictors to ensure a holistic approach to diabetes risk assessment.

 **Machine Learning Algorithms:** I employ various machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models, enabling a comparative analysis of their performance.

 **Accuracy as Metric:** Model evaluation is centered around the accuracy_score metric, allowing for a nuanced comparison of different algorithms.

 **End-to-End Workflow:** From data gathering to model deployment, the project covers all essential steps in developing a robust and scalable solution.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

 **data:** Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.

 **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

 **src:** Source code for the machine learning models, including scripts for data preprocessing and model deployment.

 **docs:** Project documentation, including this README file.
